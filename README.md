# Competitive-Tetris
A two player Tetris game that follows Object Oriented Programming fundamentals. Lead a team of 3 members to create Biquardris/Competitive Tetris as our final project for Object-Oriented Software Development (CS246) course.

Due to academic integrity concerns the source code for this project is not made publically available, however below I have attached several screenshots of the game in action and would be happy to provide it upon request.

Incorporated observer, factory and Model View Controller design patterns. It also used techniques such as Polymorphism, RAII and single responsibility principle.

Prior to coding we created a UML to serve as a guideline to plan out our program.
